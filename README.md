# ü•ã‚õ©Ô∏è Sing a song kata

The client has a code to produce a popular children's nursery rhyme. It was written by a web consultant last year. The client now wishes to produce multiple different versions of the song using the same structure but configurable for different lists of animals. The client cannot guarantee that there will be the same number of animals in each different version.
The previous developer did not provide us with documentation or testing.

## Your task

Refactor the code to fit the client's new needs by doing baby steps.
Remember to first create the tests.

## Preparation

```bash
npm i
```

## Run the tests

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
